\maketitle

\section{signal}

up 20\% from the open, \(1<= previous close <= 2\)

\section{Strategy: Add Every 5\%, Exit at 11}

enter short position at 20\% (if occurs between 9:30 and 11), add positions twice as big as the last each time the stock increases another 5\%, only exit at 11.

65 trades between February 26th and May 28th. 

\subsection{Analysis}

high correlation between number of entries and percent return: the more it goes up, the better.

	\caption{This plot shows the weighted expected return to a limited version of the main strategy. Returns are weighted by their position size. Trades with more adds have higher weight. The returns on trades with higher weight have a larger affect on the weighted average than they would in an unweighted average. The x-axis displays the maximum number of entries allowed in a single trade. In the unlimited case, a trade can be entered each time it rises 5\%. But in the case where adds are limited to 4, the total number of entries allowed in any stock is 5 (first entry then 4 adds). So this plot says that when the maximum amount of entries is 5 (i.e. at most 4 adds) the weighted returns were around 2.5\%. When the amount of entries is limited to 5 (first entry, 4 adds), stocks that rise more than 25\% beyond the signal of 20\% are not added to beyond the first 4 adds.}

But in the case where adds are limited to 4, the total number of entries allowed in any stock is 5 (first entry then 4 adds). So the top panel says that when the maximum amount of entries is 5 (i.e. at most 4 adds) the returns were around 5.75\%. When the amount of entries is limited to 5 (first entry, 4 adds), stocks that rise more than 25\% beyond the signal of 20\% are not added to beyond the first 4 adds.}
